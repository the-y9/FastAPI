# **Project Implementation Report**

### **Project Title**:

**Flask API Backend with Data Filtering, Pagination, and Tool Management**

### **Date Implemented**:

May 2025

### **Developer**:

\[Your Name]

---

## **Project Overview**

This project is a full-stack application that includes a **Flask-based backend** and a **React-based frontend**. It interacts with a **SQL Server database** to fetch and manage tool and vendor data, with features for filtering, pagination, and dynamic query rendering. The goal is to provide users with an intuitive way to filter and paginate large sets of data, while offering flexibility for both backend developers and end-users to interact with the data.

### **Main Features**:

1. **Data Fetching**: Allows users to retrieve data (inventory, vendor, etc.) from the SQL Server database.
2. **Filtering**: Supports filtering the data based on various parameters like tool number, machine, process, etc.
3. **Pagination**: Handles large datasets by allowing the user to paginate results.
4. **Dynamic Query Rendering**: Uses **Jinja2 templating** for dynamic generation of SQL queries based on user-defined filters.
5. **Environment Configurations**: All sensitive and configuration data is managed through environment variables for security.
6. **Compression**: API responses are compressed using **Flask-Compress** to improve performance.

## **Technology Stack**

### Backend:

- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework.
- **Flask-CORS**: To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) between the frontend and backend.
- **Flask-Compress**: For response compression.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM used to connect and interact with the SQL Server database.
- **Jinja2**: Templating engine for dynamic SQL query generation.
- **Dotenv**: To manage environment variables.

### Frontend:

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from React to the Flask API.
- **React-Router**: To handle navigation between different components/views.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and quick UI components.

### Database:

- **SQL Server**: The relational database to store tool, inventory, and vendor information.
- **ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)**: To connect Python with SQL Server via **pyodbc**.

---

## **Architecture Overview**

The project follows a **client-server** architecture with the following components:

1. **Flask API (Backend)**:

   - **Flask App** serves as the main server for handling requests from the React frontend.
   - The backend is responsible for fetching data from the database, applying business logic (like filtering and pagination), and returning the processed data to the frontend.
   - **Database Interaction**: SQLAlchemy ORM interacts with the SQL Server database, and dynamic queries are generated using Jinja2 templates.
   - **RESTful API Endpoints**: Multiple endpoints provide different data functionalities.

2. **React Application (Frontend)**:

   - The frontend interacts with the backend via RESTful API calls using **Axios**.
   - It provides an intuitive user interface where users can input filter criteria and navigate through the results.
   - It manages the presentation of data in tables and provides pagination controls to navigate between pages.

## **Project Structure**

### **Backend (`Flask` App)**:

1. **`main.py`**:

   - Central entry point for the Flask application.
   - Defines the API routes and logic for handling requests.
   - Handles database connectivity, query generation, and API responses.

2. **SQL Query Templates** (`sql/` folder):

   - Contains SQL templates (e.g., `data_inventory.sql`, `data_vendor.sql`) used to dynamically generate SQL queries.
   - **Jinja2** templating engine is used to render SQL queries with filters provided by the frontend.

3. **Environment Configuration** (`.env` file):

   - Contains sensitive database configuration like `DB_SERVER`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_TABLE`.
   - These environment variables are loaded at runtime using **`dotenv`**.

### **Frontend (`React` App)**:

1. **`src/components/`**:

   - **`Filter.jsx`**: Handles user input for filtering tool data.
   - **`IsInventory.jsx`**: Displays tool inventory data based on the filtering applied.
   - **`IsVendor.jsx`**: Displays vendor-related data.
   - **`PaginationControls.jsx`**: Manages the pagination logic (previous/next buttons and page number display).
   - **`GenericTable.jsx`**: A generic table component to display any type of filtered data.

2. **`App.js`**:

   - The root component that renders all the UI components (filter, data display, pagination).

## **Detailed Route Descriptions**

### **1. Home Route (`/`)**

- **Purpose**: Displays a simple greeting or index page.
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Response**: A simple string message `"Index"`.

---

### **2. `/data` Route**

- **Purpose**: Fetches data from the database.
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Response**: Returns an array of data, each element being a dictionary containing column names as keys.
- **Functionality**: Fetches all data from the table specified in the `.env` configuration. Response is formatted with the time it took to fetch the data.

---

### **3. `/cols` Route**

- **Purpose**: Returns the list of column names from the database.
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Response**: A JSON object with the time taken to retrieve the column names and the list of columns.

---

### **4. `/data_inventory` Route**

- **Purpose**: Fetches filtered and paginated inventory data.
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Query Params**:

  - `page`: The current page number for pagination.
  - `limit`: The number of items per page.
  - `process`, `machine`, `tool`, `plug`: Optional filters to apply to the query.

- **Response**: A JSON object containing:

  - `time`: Time taken to retrieve the data.
  - `length`: Number of records returned.
  - `total`: Total number of records (before pagination).
  - `qdata`: The actual data.
  - `page`: Current page.
  - `limit`: Items per page.

---

### **5. `/data_vendor` Route**

- **Purpose**: Similar to `/data_inventory`, but fetches vendor data.
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Query Params**: Similar to `/data_inventory`.
- **Response**: Similar to the `/data_inventory` endpoint.

---

## **Data Flow**

1. **Frontend (React)**:

   - The frontend sends HTTP GET requests to the Flask backend to fetch data, using **Axios**.
   - The user inputs filter criteria (such as tool number or machine) via the **`Filter.jsx`** component.
   - Pagination is managed by the **`PaginationControls.jsx`** component.

2. **Backend (Flask)**:

   - Upon receiving a request, the Flask backend reads the relevant parameters (filters, pagination) from the request.
   - It generates a dynamic SQL query using **Jinja2** templates, applying the appropriate filters and pagination logic.
   - The database is queried using **SQLAlchemy** and the results are returned to the frontend.

3. **SQL Queries**:

   - The SQL query is dynamically generated from template files located in the **`sql/`** directory.
   - Jinja2 templates replace placeholders with the actual filter values provided by the user.

4. **Response**:

   - The backend sends the filtered, paginated data back to the frontend in JSON format.
   - The frontend uses this data to render the results in a table and update the pagination controls.

## **Performance Optimizations**

1. **Response Compression**:

   - The API uses **Flask-Compress** to compress JSON responses, improving the speed of data transfer and user experience.

2. **Efficient SQL Queries**:

   - The SQL queries are optimized with **pagination** to ensure only relevant data is fetched from the database, reducing the load on the server.

---

## **Next Steps & Recommendations**

1. **Add Caching**: To further optimize performance, consider adding caching for frequently accessed data to reduce the load on the SQL Server.

2. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive tool and vendor data.

3. **Deployment**:

   - Deploy the backend to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Heroku) and the frontend to a static site hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

4. **Improve Error Handling**: Improve error handling for edge cases (e.g., no results found, database connection errors) with more detailed error messages.

---

### **Conclusion**

This project successfully integrates a Flask-based backend with a React frontend to manage tool and vendor data with advanced filtering, pagination, and dynamic query generation. The application is highly extensible, with room for additional features such as caching, authentication, and further optimizations for large-scale data management.
